# Configuring Secrets

To run the TimePhone-API service, you will need an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/).
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project if you have not yet created one.

## OpenAI API Key

1. Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Create a new [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Add your key to the `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## GCP Authentication

Google authentication is handled with a service account and a JSON key file.

1. Create a new [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) in GCP.
2. Create a new [key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) for the service account.
3. Download the key file
4. Base64 encode the key file to a single line and add it to the `.env` file as `GCP_AUTHJSON_BASE64`.

```sh
# To base64 encode the key file
cat file.json | base64 | tr -d '                                                                                                                               INT Ñ…  11s  techsquid@myhomeserver
